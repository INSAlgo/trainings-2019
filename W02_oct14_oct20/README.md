# Problems of the week

This time we try understanding an important concept : computational complexity. This will allow us to evaluate our algorithms before even coding them.

For this week's exercices we're going to take back these ones : https://github.com/INSAlgo/trainings-2018/tree/master/W03_oct15_oct21

Have fun and ask for help if needed !
If these exercices are too easy for you try solving the monthly challenges !
