# Problems of the week

Sometimes it's best not to look for the over complicated answer. Make the best decisions at a moment and be sure you won't have to regret them later with greedy algorithms

For this week's exercices we're going to take back these ones : https://github.com/INSAlgo/trainings-2018/tree/master/W09_dec10_dec16

Have fun and ask for help if needed !
If these exercices are too easy for you try solving the monthly challenges !
