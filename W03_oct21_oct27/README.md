# Problems of the week

For every algorithm problem there are inputs. How do we store them, depending on what we intend to do with them? This week's course will answer to that question, since we're talking about data structures in python!

Since we already discussed this subject last year week's exercices we're going to take back these ones : https://github.com/INSAlgo/trainings-2018/tree/master/W03_oct15_oct21

Have fun and ask for help if needed !
If these exercices are too easy for you try solving the monthly challenges !
