# Problems of the week

For the first week of the year we talk about how to write algorithm in Python, and discover how great a language it is !

Have a look at the slides if you're feeling a bit lost! You also have a home made cheat sheet right here --> https://github.com/INSAlgo/trainings-2018/blob/master/python_quickstart.pdf

For this week's exercices we're going to take back these ones : https://github.com/INSAlgo/trainings-2018/tree/master/W01_oct8_oct14

Have fun and ask for help if needed !
If these exercices are too easy for you try solving the monthly challenges !
